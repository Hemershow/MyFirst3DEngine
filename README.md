# My First 3D Graphical Engine

The main objective of this project is to create a simple 3d engine capable of rendering a simple object.

Now, this is probably not a common implementation of this, I had no prior knowledge about linear algebra, calculus or even how a 3d engine is supposed to work... So, as you can imagine, this was quite a challenge. I liked the idea of creating something I was not ready for, and after some headache, I'm proud of it, even with it's problems and bugs.

## Visual Demonstration:

## Future implementations and changes

* Find the reason why the program sometimes crashes and solve it
* Allow for different screen sizes and aspect ratios
* Make the mouse movement smoother 
* Create an object generator
